# Hidden Gems Global

## Description

This project was an idea I have had for a while, it is an app that allows a user to see posts that other users have put into the database
Allows the user to click on a single post to see more in depth details about the location and have a descripton of said location
Allows the user to login to the system allowing them to be able to create posts and share it with the world

##Future goals

Some future goals I have for the project are to utilise the google maps api to allow for my user to see exactly where the location is on the map when they select a post
To allow for a user to have ownership of a post and to edit or delete their own posts in their profile page
Add a comment section or chat form so that people can talk about their posts with others and descuss their expearences
